 * Type alias: Creating a new name for an existing type.

 *
 * Hydration: The process of taking raw data (a plain JavaScript object from the database)
 * and turning it into a Mongoose document by adding all the methods and properties defined in
 * the Mongoose schema to this object.
 * - After hydration, the document can call methods like `.save()`, `.remove()`, etc.

 *   properties and methods of a hydrated Article document.

 * `SchemaFactory`: A utility provided by Mongoose to convert a TypeScript class into a Mongoose schema.
 * - It automates the creation of a schema based on the decorators and types defined in the class.

 * `createForClass(Article)`: 
 * - This method takes the `Article` class as an argument and generates a Mongoose schema from it.
 *
 * `ArticleSchema`: 
 * - This constant holds the Mongoose schema that was generated from the `Article` class.
 *
 * You can later use `ArticleSchema` to create a Mongoose model, which allows you to perform operations
 * like creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in the MongoDB collection that corresponds to the Article schema.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * const ArticleModel = mongoose.model('Article', ArticleSchema);
